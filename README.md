Greetings, traveler of the GitHub cosmos! I am `0xPylon`, a smart contract developer harnessing the energies of the Koprulu Sector. When I'm not crafting advanced blockchain contracts, you can find me constructing additional pylons to maintain a balanced supply.

_For Aiur!_

- "When someone asks if I've tested my smart contract: 'You must construct additional unit tests!'"

- "When gas fees get too high: 'My life for Aiur... but not all my Ether!'"

- "_Zeratul once whispered to me:_ 'The blockchain's threads weave a fabric of destiny, but one can still find the loopholes.'"

1. **Solidity**: Like the Khala, I connect with the Ethereum network, crafting secure and efficient contracts.
2. **Vyper**: As agile as a Dark Templar, I can develop contracts in Vyper that are concise and transparent.
3. **Web3.js & ethers.js**: My Warp Gates to bridge the blockchain and the real world.
4. **Truffle & Hardhat**: To ensure my contracts stand strong, like a fortified Photon Cannon.
5. **Smart Contract Auditing**: Vigilant as a Sentry, I maintain security and efficiency.

_En Taro Tassadar!_
